# Exercise 2

## 2.0

Load jQuery and app.js scripts at the bottom of the page

## 2.1

In app.js, create an event listener on the `#todoapp` element that listens for a `keyup` event and logs the numerical key code of the key pressed to the browser console.

## 2.2

Within the event handler function created above, check if the key pressed is the enter key. If so, log a message to the console that reads "Todo list item added."

**Hint:** Use the functionality from Ex2.1 to determine the key code for the enter key.
